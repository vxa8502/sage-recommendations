They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and strangely enough, my ears do not sweat or become hot while wearing them. (I do not exercise with these on). You can change the volume, pause, skip tracks and take phone calls with the headset on. The battery life is impressive and the build quality is great.  These are worth every penny. I would give it 6 stars if I could!!  Way to go Bose!",
        "Best Bluetooth headphones set with noise cancellation. Very comfortable for long time.",
        "I'm not sure what I should have expected from the noise cancellation. I have found that when playing music via Bluetooth mild background sound does seem to be suppressed, but louder sounds come through. I tested the noise cancellation playing a variety of white sounds on my iPhone while playing music via my MacBook. The sounds do seem to be suppressed at low volume, but are easy to hear at higher volume. My conclusion is that noise cancellation is limited even in these highly rated earphones. They are superb earphones, well built, with great sound quality, but not sure they are worth the price."

Many of my connections I have routed behind a shelf so I found the 6 connections on one side to work well with those. That left the two rotating ports and 2 facing outward-I can access the remainder to use for charging things etc. The rotating ports did help orienting the unit so I can easily access those ports. The USB 3.0 TB HD thinks the hub is dandy."

        "This speaker is a great buy for the money. I bought it for the shower and I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />It is military grade waterproof. FYI- I do not have it in a spot in the shower that it is getting directly hit with water, but it is in a spot that it gets wet.<br /><br />I also like the features on it. You can pause songs or skip to the next one. Pickup or hangup on phone calls if you use this as a portable speaker. The size is great for travel as well. I have even taken this outside with me when I am sitting in the backyard. I am thinking about buying another for moving around and keeping one in shower since the price is so reasonable.",
        "This is a nice speaker for your shower. Has a good sound, good battery and the ability to play/pause, skip/reverse and control volume. My helpful hint, when recharging it is to take the speaker and suction cup off together, if you try to take the speaker off of the suction cup, you run the risk of breaking the suction cup. (This happened to the last one I had and then that rolled off the soap dish and broke.)",
        "Nice battery life. good sound. The speaker is located in the back so when stuck to my shower wall it echos the sound in the shower / tub. Only downside is be careful of the rubber plug for the charging port, if it breaks it's not water resistant anymore."
